### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)

- A Google Cloud Project with the Gemini API enabled and an API Key.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    https://github.com/balajiudayagiri/UdyatAI.git
    cd udyatai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install

    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Google Gemini API Key:

    ```env
    # .env

    GOOGLE_AI_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY

    # You might also need to configure Google OAuth credentials if authentication is implemented
    # GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
    # GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
    # GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual API key.
